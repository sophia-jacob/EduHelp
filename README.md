# EduHelp

What my project does:
It is called EduHelp and it is meant to help those who feel like they want to practice a bit more in subjects like Calculus and Biology.

Why I made it:
I felt like it would be nice to have a site where you can easily practice for classes using flashcards and practice quizzes.

How I made it:
I used HTML and CSS for the layout and design. I used JavaScript for the quizzes to count right and wrong answers.

What I struggled with/learned:
It was a challenge to get the flashcards to have a 3D effect using CSS, which I was eventually able to do and learned a lot from.
